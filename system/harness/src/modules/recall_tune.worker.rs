//! `hex-recall-tune` — weekly bounded recall-parameter auto-tuner (hill-climber
//! stage 1, spec Tzxmamhr8).
//!
//! Every Sunday 05:00 UTC this runs one bounded hill-climbing step over the
//! recall ranking parameters and, only when a candidate provably holds up on a
//! disjoint held-out slice, auto-lands it as the INSTANCE config
//! (`$HEX_DIR/.hex/config/recall.toml`). It NEVER commits to foundation develop
//! — the auto-land unit is a single archived, revertible file (design doc
//! 2026-08-19; deliberate deviation recorded in the spec).
//!
//! One run, in order:
//!   (i)   SKIP LOUDLY unless BOTH opt-in slices exist —
//!         `recall-cases-tuning.toml` and `recall-cases-heldout.toml`. Foundation
//!         ships to every instance; most never opt in, so absent slices are
//!         expected, never silent (a `recall_tune.skipped` event + stderr line).
//!   (ii)  Snapshot memory.db ONCE so every score in the run is frozen and
//!         comparable. Absent memory.db is LOUD (S6), not a benign skip.
//!   (viii)Revert check FIRST: re-score the live config on the fresh snapshot
//!         against the last win's recorded pre-change held-out score; on a
//!         regression, restore the archived `.prev` and log a reverted regret.
//!   (iii) Propose a bounded neighborhood of variants around the current config
//!         (hard cap `MAX_VARIANTS`). Proposal takes ONLY the current config —
//!         its signature has no cases path, so the held-out slice is
//!         structurally unable to influence it.
//!   (iv)  Score current + variants on the TUNING slice only; pick the best.
//!   (v)   Final gate on the HELD-OUT slice — the ONLY place a candidate is
//!         scored against held-out. The held-out path is carried in a
//!         `HeldoutPath` newtype that exposes no `Deref`/`AsRef`, so it cannot
//!         silently coerce into the tuning scorer.
//!   (vi)  Land iff held-out score >= current AND zero held-out regressions.
//!   (vii) On land: archive the previous `recall.toml` with a timestamped
//!         `.prev` suffix, atomically write the new one, append a `win_log` row.
//!         On reject: append a `regret_log` row.
//!
//! Every outcome (skip / revert / no-improvement / land / reject) emits
//! telemetry; every real failure returns `Err` (loud status=error row + stderr),
//! per SO S6. `win_log`/`regret_log` live in `memory.db` (migration in
//! `hex::memory::schema`).
