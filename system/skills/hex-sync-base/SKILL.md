# sync-safe

Compare local hex against hex and push improvements upstream.

## Steps

1. **Detect HEX_DIR and BASE_DIR**
   - HEX_DIR: walk up from script to find CLAUDE.md
   - BASE_DIR: `~/github.com/mrap/hex`

2. **Diff shared files**
   Compare these directories between hex and hex:
   - `dot-claude/scripts/` vs `.hex/scripts/`
   - `dot-claude/skills/` vs `.hex/skills/`
   - `dot-claude/commands/` vs `.claude/commands/`
   - `CLAUDE.md` (root)

   For each file that exists in both locations, diff them.
   For files only in hex, flag as "new, consider adding."
   For files only in hex, flag as "missing locally, may need pull."

3. **Classify each diff**
   For each changed file, determine:
   - **Push upstream**: Generic improvement that benefits all hex users
   - **Local only**: user-specific customization (personal data, preferences)
   - **Needs work**: Change is valuable but needs generalization before pushing (e.g., hardcoded timezone)

   Present a table to the user with the classification and a one-line summary of each change.

4. **Apply approved changes**
   For each file the user approves:
   - Copy the file to the corresponding location in hex
   - Note: hex uses `.hex/` but hex base repo uses `dot-claude/` (renamed during install)

5. **Commit and push hex**
   - Stage changed files in hex
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message
   - Push to origin

6. **Update CLAUDE.md if needed**
   For CLAUDE.md changes that are generic (new standing orders, protocol updates), apply them to the hex CLAUDE.md. Skip user-specific content (project references, personal evolution items).

## Path Mapping

| hex location | hex location |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `.hex/scripts/` | `dot-claude/scripts/` |
| `.hex/skills/` | `dot-claude/skills/` |
| `.claude/commands/` | `dot-claude/commands/` | (stays in .claude/) |
| `.hex/hooks/` | `dot-claude/hooks/` | (stays in .claude/) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` |

## Guards

Three layers prevent personal data from leaking:

1. **Path allowlist** (`sync-guard.sh check-path`): Only approved paths can be synced. Deny by default.
2. **Content scanner** (`sync-guard.sh scan-file`): Before copying, scan each file for personal data (names, emails, personal file references). Block if anything matches.
3. **Pre-commit hook**: hex has a pre-commit hook that runs `sync-guard.sh scan-all` as the last line of defense.

**Before copying any file**, run:
```bash
bash $HEX_DIR/.hex/scripts/sync-guard.sh check-path "dot-claude/scripts/foo.sh"
bash $HEX_DIR/.hex/scripts/sync-guard.sh scan-file /path/to/file
```

If either check fails, DO NOT copy the file. Surface the issue to the user.

## Rules

- Run sync-guard.sh on every file before copying. No exceptions.
- Never push personal data (me/, people/, projects/, landings/, evolution/, todo.md)
- Never push settings.json (contains personal hooks and statusline config)
- Always diff before copying. Show the diff to the user.
- Commit to hex with a clear message about what changed and why.
- After pushing, verify the commit landed with `git log -1` in hex.
