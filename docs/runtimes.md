# Codex and Claude runtime parity notes

Facts recorded during the Codex parity spikes (2026-09-07). Every fact carries the exact command that produced it. Absolute temp paths are redacted to `<TMP>`; account identifiers are redacted to `<REDACTED>`.

## Skills and instruction files

Recorded 2026-09-07 against codex-cli 0.153.4 and Claude Code 2.1.263. Probes ran in a temp project with a temp `CODEX_HOME` seeded only with a copy of `~/.codex/auth.json`. Setup:

```
T=$(mktemp -d) && mkdir -p "$T/home"
cp ~/.codex/auth.json "$T/home/auth.json" && chmod 600 "$T/home/auth.json"
mkdir -p "$T/proj" && (cd "$T/proj" && git init -q)
cp -R system/skills/hex-doctor "$T/skillcopy/hex-doctor"
mkdir -p "$T/proj/.agents/skills"
ln -s "$T/skillcopy/hex-doctor" "$T/proj/.agents/skills/hex-doctor"
```

### Codex discovers project skills from `.agents/skills/`

Codex 0.153.4 surfaces skills to the model in a `<skills_instructions>` developer message. It reads two skill roots: `r0` = `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system` (built-in system skills) and `r1` = `<project>/.agents/skills` (project skills). Command:

```
cd "$T/proj" && CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex debug prompt-input "hi"
```

The first developer message rendered these roots and skills (temp paths redacted):

```
### Skill roots
- `r0` = `<TMP>/home/skills/.system`
- `r1` = `<TMP>/proj/.agents/skills`
### Available skills
- imagegen: ... (file: r0/imagegen/SKILL.md)
- openai-docs: ... (file: r0/openai-docs/SKILL.md)
- plugin-creator: ... (file: r0/plugin-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-creator: ... (file: r0/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: ... (file: r0/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
- hex-doctor: Validate hex agent structure and repair issues. ... (file: r1/hex-doctor/SKILL.md)
## Hook payloads

Facts recorded 2026-09-07 against codex-cli 0.153.4 (ChatGPT auth). Every probe
used a temp CODEX_HOME plus a temp git project. The same dump hook was installed
in BOTH layers: the user layer `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` and the project layer
`<proj>/.codex/hooks.json`. The dump hook is a silent script that writes each
hook invocation's stdin JSON to its own file and exits 0. Hooks ran headless via
`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` (no interactive trust is possible headless; a
trusted-hash run is T3's concern).

Setup (abridged):

```
T=$(mktemp -d) && mkdir -p "$T/home" "$T/proj/.codex"
cp ~/.codex/auth.json "$T/home/auth.json" && chmod 600 "$T/home/auth.json"
# dump.sh writes stdin to a per-probe log dir, silent, exit 0
# hooks.json registers dump.sh for all 12 events; copied to $T/home/hooks.json
#   and $T/proj/.codex/hooks.json
printf '[projects."%s"]\ntrust_level = "trusted"\n' "$T/proj" > "$T/home/config.toml"
( cd "$T/proj" && git init -q && git commit --allow-empty -qm init )
```

### Both hook layers fire

Every event fired twice under one run: once from the user-layer
`$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` and once from the project-layer
`<proj>/.codex/hooks.json`. Both layers are read and both run. Command:

```
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -s workspace-write \
  --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust -C "$T/proj" \
  "Run the shell command: echo hello-from-probe-A . After it runs, reply with the single word DONE and stop." \
  < /dev/null
```

The two-layer conclusion is not just a doubled count: the run's own notices name
both files by path (from the probe D stream, scrubbed):

```
clamping SessionEnd hook timeout to 3s in <TMP>/home/hooks.json
clamping SessionEnd hook timeout to 3s in <TMP>/proj/.codex/hooks.json
```

### Common envelope

Most events share: `session_id`, `turn_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`,
`hook_event_name`, `model`, `permission_mode`. Under `codex exec` the approval
policy is `never`, so `permission_mode` reads `"bypassPermissions"` in every
payload (this reflects exec's default approval policy, not the hook-trust
bypass). `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` omit `turn_id`; `SessionEnd` also omits
`model` and `permission_mode`. Fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/codex/hooks/`
(temp paths, ids, and account fields scrubbed to `<TMP>`, `<SESSION_ID>`,
`<TURN_ID>`, `<TOOL_USE_ID>`, `<AGENT_ID>`, `<HOME_DIR>`).

### Per-event notes

- SessionStart carries `source`. Observed values: `"startup"` (normal start) and
  `"compact"` (a fresh SessionStart fires after an auto-compaction). Fixtures:
  `session-start.json`, `session-start-compact.json`.
- UserPromptSubmit carries `prompt` (the raw user text). Fixture:
  `user-prompt-submit.json`.
- PreToolUse carries `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_use_id`. The shell tool is
  reported as `tool_name: "Bash"`; patches as `tool_name: "apply_patch"`.
  Fixtures: `pre-tool-use-shell.json`, `pre-tool-use-apply-patch.json`.
- PostToolUse adds `tool_response` to the PreToolUse shape. Fixture:
  `post-tool-use.json`.
- Stop carries `stop_hook_active` (observed `false`) and `last_assistant_message`
  (observed `"DONE"`). Both keys are present. Fixture: `stop.json`.
- SessionEnd fires on exec completion. It carries `reason` (observed `"other"`)
  and a minimal envelope (`session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`,
  `hook_event_name`). Its hook timeout is clamped to 3s regardless of the
  configured value (the run emits a notice `clamping SessionEnd hook timeout to
  3s`). Fixture: `session-end.json`.

### apply_patch from a subdirectory

Run from a subdirectory with `-C <proj>/sub`, editing a pre-created file:

```
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -s workspace-write \
  --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust -C "$T/proj/sub" \
  "Edit the file target.txt in the current directory: append a third line ... Use the apply_patch tool ..." \
  < /dev/null
```

The PreToolUse payload's `cwd` is the subdirectory, and the patch body in
`tool_input.command` names the file cwd-relative (`*** Update File: target.txt`),
NOT as an absolute path and NOT relative to the git root. Patch paths are
resolved against the invocation cwd. Fixture: `pre-tool-use-apply-patch.json`.

### Subagent events (multi_agent)

`multi_agent` is a stable feature and effective by default; the probe added
`--enable multi_agent` and asked the model to spawn one subagent:

```
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -s workspace-write \
  --enable multi_agent --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust -C "$T/proj" \
  "Launch one subagent (use your agent/task tool) to compute 2+2 and report ..." \
  < /dev/null
```

Findings:

- The project skill `hex-doctor`, reached through the `.agents/skills/hex-doctor` symlink, is surfaced. Codex follows the symlink; the model sees the skill under root `r1`.
- Codex renders only the `name` and `description` frontmatter keys. The hex-doctor `SKILL.md` carries an extra `version: 1.0.0` frontmatter key and a `<!-- # sync-safe -->` comment. Neither reaches the model and neither triggers a warning. Extra frontmatter keys are silently ignored (observed on the `codex debug prompt-input` surface; the `codex exec` surface is recorded below).
- Codex seeds built-in system skills into a fresh `CODEX_HOME` on first use. `ls "$T/home/skills/.system"` lists a `.codex-system-skills.marker` file plus `imagegen`, `openai-docs`, `plugin-creator`, `review-agent`, `skill-creator`, and `skill-installer`. Six of these are surfaced to the model; `review-agent` exists on disk but is not in the model-visible list.

Live enumeration on the `codex exec` path confirms the same discovery and confirms no frontmatter warning:

```
cd "$T/proj" && CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --output-schema "$T/a-schema.json" -o "$T/a-out.json" \
  -s read-only -m gpt-5.4-mini "List the exact names of every skill available to you." < /dev/null
```

- Exit 0. The `-o` structured output conformed to the flat schema and returned: `imagegen`, `openai-docs`, `plugin-creator`, `skill-creator`, `skill-installer`, `hex-doctor`, plus two plugin-namespaced entries (`deep-research-work:deep-research`, `plugin-management:plugin-management`). The two namespaced entries are a model self-report artifact and are not in the authoritative `<skills_instructions>` block; treat `codex debug prompt-input` as the source of truth for what the model actually sees.
- `codex exec` stderr logged `codex_skills_extension::host_service: skills cache cleared` and a feature list including `SkillSearch`, `SkillMcpDependencyInstall`, and `Plugins`. There was no frontmatter, unknown-field, or version-key warning on the exec path either. Codex silently ignores unrecognized `SKILL.md` frontmatter keys (the hex `version` key and the `<!-- # sync-safe -->` comment) on both the prompt-input and exec surfaces.

### Codex reads a CLAUDE.md via `project_doc_fallback_filenames`

Codex reads only `AGENTS.md` as a project doc by default. Point it at `CLAUDE.md` with the user-config key `project_doc_fallback_filenames`. Setup: a temp project holding only `CLAUDE.md` (codeword `FALLBACKWORD-9931`) and no `AGENTS.md`; the key written as a top-level key in the temp user config:

```
printf 'project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]\n' > "$T/home/config.toml"
cd "$T/projb" && CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex debug prompt-input "What codeword is in my project instructions?"
```

With the key set, the model-visible prompt contains a project-doc block (temp path redacted):

```
# AGENTS.md instructions for <TMP>/projb
<INSTRUCTIONS>
# Project Notes
The project codeword is FALLBACKWORD-9931.
</INSTRUCTIONS>
```

Control: with `$T/home/config.toml` removed, the same command yields zero matches for `FALLBACKWORD-9931`. So the fallback key is what makes `CLAUDE.md` reach the model; without it `CLAUDE.md` is ignored. Codex labels the injected `CLAUDE.md` block as `AGENTS.md instructions`, treating the fallback file as an AGENTS.md-equivalent project doc.

`project_doc_fallback_filenames` is accepted under `--strict-config` (it is a recognized key in 0.153.4, not a STOP condition). Note `codex debug prompt-input` does not accept `--strict-config`; only `codex exec` gates config strictly. The live check both validates the key and confirms the codeword reaches the model:

```
cd "$T/projb" && CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --strict-config -s read-only -m gpt-5.4-mini \
  "What codeword is in my project instructions? Answer with only the codeword." < /dev/null
```

Exit 0 (strict-config did not reject the key) and the model answered `FALLBACKWORD-9931`.

### Claude Code and a symlinked CLAUDE.md

Claude Code 2.1.263 follows a symlinked `CLAUDE.md`. To separate "symlink followed" from "AGENTS.md read natively" (Claude also reads `AGENTS.md`), the test dir uses distinct codewords: a real `AGENTS.md` with `ALPHA-AGENTS-4471`, a real `INSTRUCTIONS-REAL.md` with `BRAVO-SYMLINK-8802`, and `CLAUDE.md` as a symlink to `INSTRUCTIONS-REAL.md`. This deviates from the brief's `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` layout on purpose: a shared codeword could not tell the two read paths apart. The Claude call ran with a temp `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` seeded with copies of `~/.claude/.credentials.json` and `~/.claude.json` so auth works while all writes stay isolated (the real `~/.claude.json` mtime was unchanged before and after):

```
CT=$(mktemp -d)
cp ~/.claude/.credentials.json "$CT/.credentials.json" && chmod 600 "$CT/.credentials.json"
cp ~/.claude.json "$CT/.claude.json" && chmod 600 "$CT/.claude.json"
cd "$T/projc" && CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$CT" claude -p --model sonnet --output-format json \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions "List every codeword that appears in your project instructions. Include all of them."
rm -rf "$CT"
```

Result (`is_error: false`, one turn): `The codeword in my project instructions is: BRAVO-SYMLINK-8802`. Only `BRAVO-SYMLINK-8802` appeared; `ALPHA-AGENTS-4471` did not.

Findings:

- Claude Code follows the `CLAUDE.md` symlink and reads its target. `BRAVO-SYMLINK-8802` is reachable only through the `CLAUDE.md` symlink, and it came back, so the symlink is followed (not skipped for being a symlink).
- With a `CLAUDE.md` present, the sibling `AGENTS.md` codeword (`ALPHA-AGENTS-4471`) did not surface. In this configuration `CLAUDE.md` is the project-instruction file Claude used; `AGENTS.md` did not contribute its codeword. This is an observation about precedence in the presence of `CLAUDE.md`, not a claim that Claude never reads `AGENTS.md`.
- Auth isolation note: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` redirects both the config file and the credentials lookup. Pointing it at an empty temp dir yields `Not logged in`; seeding it with a copy of `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (plus `~/.claude.json`) restores auth while keeping the real user config untouched.

### Parity summary

- Codex project skills live under `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; symlinked skill dirs are followed; only `name` and `description` frontmatter are used and extra keys are ignored silently. Where Claude Code discovers project skills was not probed in this spike; a shared `SKILL.md` body still needs to be reachable from whatever root each runtime scans, and Codex following symlinks makes a single physical skill dir bridgeable.
- Codex reads `AGENTS.md` by default and reads `CLAUDE.md` only when `project_doc_fallback_filenames` includes it. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` by default and follows a `CLAUDE.md` symlink. A `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` symlink is therefore a workable single-source-of-truth bridge for Claude; for Codex the `project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]` key is the bridge in the other direction.
- SubagentStart carries `agent_id` and `agent_type` (observed `"default"`); its
  `session_id` is the PARENT session. Fixture: `subagent-start.json`.
- SubagentStop carries `agent_id`, `agent_type`, `agent_transcript_path` (the
  subagent's own rollout), `stop_hook_active`, and `last_assistant_message` (the
  subagent's answer, observed `"4"`). Fixture: `subagent-stop.json`.
- The parent's orchestration tool calls are `spawn_agent` and
  `multi_agent_v1wait_agent`; each produced its own PreToolUse and PostToolUse.
- UserPromptSubmit DOES fire for the subagent's prompt. In the subagent run
  UserPromptSubmit fired for both the parent prompt and the subagent prompt
  (`"Compute 2+2 and report only the result succinctly."`).
- PreToolUse and PostToolUse DO fire for the subagent's own tool calls. A second
  probe instructed the subagent to run `echo i-am-the-subagent`; that Bash call
  produced its own PreToolUse and PostToolUse.
- Stop does NOT fire separately for the subagent. Only the main agent emits Stop;
  the subagent's terminal hook is SubagentStop.

### Compaction events

Reachable headless by shrinking the context window and driving several turns:

```
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -s workspace-write \
  -c model_context_window=16000 --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust -C "$T/proj" \
  "Do the following one command at a time ... (1) run 'seq 1 400'; ... (5) run 'seq 1601 2000'. After all five, reply DONE." \
  < /dev/null
```

PreCompact and PostCompact both fired, each carrying `trigger` (observed
`"auto"`) plus the common envelope. After the auto-compaction a new SessionStart
fired with `source: "compact"`. Fixtures: `pre-compact.json`,
`post-compact.json`. Limitation: each fixture was scrubbed independently, so
`session-start.json` and `session-start-compact.json` both show `<SESSION_ID>`
and the committed fixtures cannot answer whether an auto-compaction keeps the same
session id or starts a new thread. A fresh live run is needed to settle that.

### Events not reached headless

- PermissionRequest did not fire under the invocations probed here, which all ran
  `approval_policy = never` (the exec default; no interactive approval requests are
  raised). The `codex exec --approve-for-me` path routes approval requests through
  automated review and was not probed, so PermissionRequest may be reachable there.
- Interrupt did not fire under the one-shot runs probed here; it needs an interrupt
  signal, which these headless runs did not produce. Not probed via other paths.

### HookStarted / HookCompleted are NOT in the --json stream

Grepping the captured `--json` stream found no `HookStarted`/`HookCompleted`
lines (also checked case-insensitive and snake_case). Command:

```
grep -iE 'hookstarted|hookcompleted|hook_started|hook_completed' probeA.jsonl
```

The `--json` stream event types are `thread.started`, `turn.started`,
`turn.completed`, `item.started`, `item.completed`. Hook activity surfaces only
as `item.completed` records of `type: "error"` (for example the hook-trust bypass
warning and the timeout-clamp notices); there is no dedicated hook lifecycle
event in the stream. A consumer that needs hook observability must read the hook
process side effects, not the JSON stream.

### Manual TUI check (S0.11, cannot run headless)

One interactive TUI turn is not reproducible headless. Manual step for Mike:
start `codex` (interactive TUI) inside a project that has the dump hook
installed, submit one prompt that triggers a shell tool call, and confirm the
same event sequence lands in the hook log dir (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit,
PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) plus any PermissionRequest raised when a command
needs approval. The interactive PermissionRequest payload is the one field this
headless spike could not capture; record its shape when performed.

Verified facts about the agent runtimes hex must target for Codex parity. Each
fact carries the exact command that produced it. All probes ran against
codex-cli 0.153.4 on macOS (Apple Silicon), logged in with ChatGPT auth.

Probe convention used throughout: every probe runs against a throwaway
`CODEX_HOME` that only holds a copy of `auth.json`, and against a git
initialized temp project. The setup is:

```bash
T=$(mktemp -d /tmp/hex-p0-t1.XXXXXX)
mkdir -p "$T/home"
cp ~/.codex/auth.json "$T/home/auth.json"
chmod 600 "$T/home/auth.json"
PROJ="$T/proj"; mkdir -p "$PROJ/.codex"
( cd "$PROJ" && git init -q && git commit -q --allow-empty -m init )
# Trust the project layer. IMPORTANT: use the resolved physical path.
REALPROJ=$(cd "$PROJ" && pwd -P)   # macOS resolves /tmp to /private/tmp
printf '[projects."%s"]\ntrust_level = "trusted"\n' "$REALPROJ" > "$T/home/config.toml"
```

Gotcha that bit every project layer probe: on macOS `/tmp` is a symlink to
`/private/tmp`, and Codex canonicalizes the project path before matching it
against `[projects."..."]` trust keys. A trust entry keyed on the `/tmp/...`
spelling never matches, so the project `.codex/config.toml` is silently ignored.
Always key the trust entry on `pwd -P` (the `/private/tmp/...` form).

## Exec envelope

`codex exec --json` prints one JSON object per line (JSONL). A one turn run
emits exactly four event types, in order: `thread.started`, `turn.started`,
`item.completed`, `turn.completed`.

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s read-only \
  "Reply with exactly the single word: hello" < /dev/null
```

Result (captured, scrubbed, in `tests/fixtures/codex/exec-envelope.jsonl`):

- `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"<THREAD_ID>"}` carries the only thread
  identifier in the stream. It is a UUID; scrub it in fixtures.
- `{"type":"turn.started"}` has no fields.
- `{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_0","type":"agent_message","text":"hello"}}`
  carries the assistant text. Tool calls appear as their own `item.completed`
  events with `item.type` of `command_execution` (see Shell environment policy).
- `{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{...}}` carries token usage. Observed keys:
  `input_tokens` (11635), `cached_input_tokens` (8448),
  `cache_write_input_tokens` (0), `output_tokens` (18),
  `reasoning_output_tokens` (11).

The human readable progress and all `INFO` tracing go to stderr, never to the
`--json` stdout stream, so `--json` stdout is safe to parse line by line.

## Output schema

`--output-schema FILE` forwards the schema to the model API as a strict
structured output (`response_format` named `codex_output_schema`). Codex does
not soften or fall back: a schema the API rejects fails the whole turn.

Flat object schema (`additionalProperties:false`, three required fields), in
`tests/fixtures/codex/exec-output-schema.json`:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s read-only \
  --output-schema "$T/schema-flat.json" -o "$T/result-flat.json" \
  "Return a JSON object for a task titled 'demo', count 3, not done." < /dev/null
```

Result (exit 0): the `-o` file holds exactly the required keys and nothing else,
`{"title":"demo","count":3,"done":false}`
(`tests/fixtures/codex/exec-output-schema.result.json`). Conformance is strict.

Nested object schema (a `meta` object with its own required fields), in
`tests/fixtures/codex/exec-output-schema.nested.json`:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s read-only \
  --output-schema "$T/schema-nested.json" -o "$T/result-nested.json" \
  "Return a JSON object titled 'demo' with meta.count 2 and meta.tags ['a','b']." < /dev/null
```

Result (exit 0): `{"title":"demo","meta":{"count":2,"tags":["a","b"]}}`
(`tests/fixtures/codex/exec-output-schema.nested.result.json`). Nested objects
are supported and strictly conformed.

Top level `oneOf` schema, in `tests/fixtures/codex/exec-output-schema.oneof.json`:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s read-only \
  --output-schema "$T/schema-oneof.json" -o "$T/result-oneof.json" \
  "Return a JSON object with kind 'number' and value 7." < /dev/null
```

Result (exit 1): no `-o` file is written. The stream emits an `error` event and
a `turn.failed` event carrying the API rejection
(`tests/fixtures/codex/exec-output-schema.oneof.error.json`):
`invalid_request_error`, code `invalid_json_schema`, message
`Invalid schema for response_format 'codex_output_schema': In context=(), 'oneOf' is not permitted.`,
status 400. There is no fallback; the process exits non zero.

Takeaway for parity: Codex enforces the OpenAI structured output subset. Flat
and nested objects with `additionalProperties:false` and `required` conform.
Constructs the API disallows (top level `oneOf`) fail the turn rather than
degrade.

## Stdin prompt

The positional `-` is not required to read a prompt from stdin. When stdin is a
pipe, Codex reads it as the prompt whether or not `-` is given. When a positional
prompt is also supplied, piped stdin is appended to it as a `<stdin>` block.
The help text states this and the probes confirm it. Test prompt: 174206 bytes
of filler ending with the codeword `PLATINUM-WALRUS-42` and an instruction to
reply with only that codeword.

```bash
# Case 1: positional '-' with piped stdin
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s read-only - < "$T/big.txt"
# Case 2: no positional at all, piped stdin
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s read-only   < "$T/big.txt"
# Case 3: positional prompt plus piped stdin
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s read-only \
  "There is a codeword near the end of the appended text. Reply with only that codeword." < "$T/big.txt"
```

Result:

- Case 1 (`-`): the assistant reply is `PLATINUM-WALRUS-42`. The codeword sits at
  byte 174000 or so, so echoing it proves the full 170 KB prompt reached the
  model. One run first returned a safety refusal that still referenced the
  hidden codeword (proving it read the tail); an immediate re run echoed the
  codeword. The refusal is model nondeterminism on the adversarial framing, not
  a `-` behavior difference.
- Case 2 (no positional): reply `PLATINUM-WALRUS-42`. Same stdin as case 1, so
  `-` is confirmed optional.
- Case 3 (positional plus stdin): reply `PLATINUM-WALRUS-42`. Stderr logs
  `Reading additional input from stdin...`; the piped text is appended to the
  positional prompt as a `<stdin>` block.

## Shell environment policy

The tool shell inherits the launching process environment by default, including
variables whose names look like secrets. There is no default name based
stripping of `KEY`, `SECRET`, or `TOKEN` variables. Probe: export four vars in
the launching shell, then ask the model to run a shell command that lists the
matching variable names.

```bash
# Default policy
MY_TEST_KEY=1 MY_TEST_SECRET=1 MY_TEST_TOKEN=1 PLAIN=1 \
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s workspace-write \
  "Run this exact shell command and report its full stdout verbatim (names only, no values): env | grep -E 'KEY|SECRET|TOKEN' | cut -d= -f1 | sort" < /dev/null

# Same prompt, inherit all of the parent environment
MY_TEST_KEY=1 MY_TEST_SECRET=1 MY_TEST_TOKEN=1 PLAIN=1 \
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json -m gpt-5.4-mini -C "$PROJ" -s workspace-write \
  -c shell_environment_policy.inherit=all \
  "Run this exact shell command and report its full stdout verbatim (names only, no values): env | grep -E 'KEY|SECRET|TOKEN' | cut -d= -f1 | sort" < /dev/null
```

The model makes a real shell tool call (visible in the stream as an
`item.completed` with `item.type` `command_execution`, wrapping the command in
the user shell). The `cut -d= -f1 | sort` above emits the matching names; the
counts below are the length of each list. Matching variable names seen by the
tool shell:

- Default policy (5 names): `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN`, `MY_TEST_KEY`,
  `MY_TEST_SECRET`, `MY_TEST_TOKEN`, `STARSHIP_SESSION_KEY`.
- With `-c shell_environment_policy.inherit=all` (4 names):
  `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN`, `MY_TEST_KEY`, `MY_TEST_SECRET`, `MY_TEST_TOKEN`.

The load bearing signal is that `MY_TEST_KEY`, `MY_TEST_SECRET`, and
`MY_TEST_TOKEN` reached the tool shell under both policies. These three are ad
hoc exports in the launching shell that no shell profile sets, so their presence
in the tool shell can only be parent environment inheritance. That proves there
is no default name based stripping, independent of any shell wrapping question.
The 5 versus 4 difference does not weaken that inference, but its cause is worth
recording rather than dismissing. In these two runs the command was executed as
`/bin/zsh -lc "..."` under the default policy and `/bin/zsh -c "..."` under
`inherit=all`. The login form (`-lc`) re sources the user profile, which sets
`STARSHIP_SESSION_KEY` fresh; the non login form does not, which accounts for the
one extra name. What this probe does not settle is why the invocation form
changed between the two runs: whether the `shell_environment_policy.inherit` key
itself governs whether the tool shell is a login shell, or the form varied for an
unrelated reason. Phase 2 and 3 care whether the Codex tool shell re sources the
user profile, so this stays an open follow-up (recorded in the ledger), not a
closed result.

Parity implication: a hex process that shells out to `codex exec` must assume
the model's tool shell can read every secret in the hex process environment.
Scrub or drop secrets before launching Codex; do not rely on a default policy to
hide them. The model itself refused to echo secret values verbatim, but that is
a model behavior, not an environment guarantee.

## Prompt input debug

`codex debug prompt-input "<prompt>"` renders the model visible input as a JSON
array of messages. It has no `-C` flag, so run it from inside the project
directory. It makes no model call, so it does not consume quota. The array holds
one message per input block; each message is
`{type:"message", id, role, content, internal_chat_message_metadata_passthrough}`
with `content` a list of text parts. A one turn setup emits five messages: three
`developer` role (system and tool preamble), then two `user` role. The first
`user` message carries three separate text parts, tagged in
`internal_chat_message_metadata_passthrough.content_item_kinds` as
`plugins.recommendations`, `agents_md.instructions`, and
`environments.environment_context`. The project `AGENTS.md` is its own
`agents_md.instructions` part (embedded as `# AGENTS.md instructions for <path>`
wrapping an `<INSTRUCTIONS>` block); it sits alongside a distinct
`<environment_context>` part, not inside it. The second `user` message is the
user prompt. Parity gates that read this fixture should locate the `AGENTS.md` by
matching the `agents_md.instructions` kind string, not by indexing a fixed
`content` position: Codex may add or reorder parts (for example, the
`plugins.recommendations` part is absent when no plugins are recommended), which
would shift positional offsets. The scrubbed and truncated shape is in
`tests/fixtures/codex/prompt-input.json` (every string over 200 chars is cut with
a note of its original length).

The probe uses a 40 KB `AGENTS.md` (40975 bytes on disk) with an early marker
`CODEWORD-EARLY-ALPHA` near the top and a tail marker `CODEWORD-TAIL-OMEGA` past
the 39 KB mark, plus `project_doc_max_bytes = 131072` in the project
`.codex/config.toml`.

```bash
( cd "$PROJ" && CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex debug prompt-input \
    "What are the codewords in my project instructions?" )
```

Result:

- With the trust entry keyed on the wrong `/tmp/...` path, the project config is
  ignored, the default `project_doc_max_bytes` (32 KB) applies, and the tail
  marker is absent (the `AGENTS.md` bearing message stops around 32 KB). This is
  the trust path gotcha described at the top of this file.
- With the trust entry keyed on `pwd -P` (`/private/tmp/...`), the project config
  applies and the `AGENTS.md` reaches the model in full. Measured on the raw
  (unredacted) output: `grep -c CODEWORD-TAIL-OMEGA out.json` returns 1, and a
  python `len()` over the joined text parts of the `AGENTS.md` bearing user
  message returns 45357 chars, holding both `CODEWORD-EARLY-ALPHA` and
  `CODEWORD-TAIL-OMEGA`. That 45357 is the whole first `user` message (the three
  parts joined: `plugins.recommendations` plus `agents_md.instructions` plus
  `environments.environment_context`), not the `AGENTS.md` alone. The `AGENTS.md`
  text is its own part, embedded as `# AGENTS.md instructions for <path>` wrapping
  an `<INSTRUCTIONS>` block; the fixture's truncation note records that part's
  original length as 41071 chars, which is the 40975 byte on-disk file plus the
  `# AGENTS.md instructions ...` / `<INSTRUCTIONS>` wrapper.
- The same full delivery happens with a CLI override, no project config or trust
  entry needed:
  `codex debug prompt-input -c project_doc_max_bytes=131072 "..."` echoes both
  markers.

Parity implication: to feed a large hex `AGENTS.md` to Codex, raise
`project_doc_max_bytes` (default 32 KB truncates silently). Either set it in a
trusted project `.codex/config.toml` (trust keyed on the resolved path) or pass
`-c project_doc_max_bytes=<n>` on the command line.
## Headless auth

Facts verified against codex-cli 0.153.4 on this Mac (2026-09-07, ChatGPT login,
plan_type pro). Every probe uses an isolated temp CODEX_HOME seeded from a copy of
the real auth.json. The shared setup for the commands below is:

```
T=$(mktemp -d); mkdir -p "$T/home" "$T/proj"
cp ~/.codex/auth.json "$T/home/auth.json"; chmod 600 "$T/home/auth.json"
```

Binary location drift. The spec brief states codex lives at /opt/homebrew/bin/codex.
On this Mac it is a standalone install at ~/.local/bin/codex (a symlink into
~/.codex/packages/standalone/current/bin/codex); /opt/homebrew/bin/codex does not
exist. A stripped PATH must therefore include ~/.local/bin.

```
ls -la ~/.local/bin/codex        # -> symlink to ~/.codex/packages/standalone/current/bin/codex
ls -la /opt/homebrew/bin/codex   # -> No such file or directory
```

Headless from a fully stripped, non-login environment works (exit 0, model replies).
`env -i` clears the environment; codex only needs HOME, a PATH that contains its
binary, and CODEX_HOME.

```
env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:"$HOME/.local/bin" CODEX_HOME="$T/home" \
  codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini \
  "Reply with exactly the single word: HEADLESS_OK and nothing else." < /dev/null
# -> exit 0; item.completed agent_message text = "HEADLESS_OK"
```

The exec --json event stream uses item.* events (for example
item.completed with item.type = agent_message), not the event_msg shape found in
the session rollout files.

CODEX_API_KEY in the environment wins over the ChatGPT tokens in auth.json. Setting
a bogus value flips auth to ApiKey mode and the run fails with a 401 before any
usable turn. This is the precedence signal.

```
CODEX_API_KEY=sk-bogus CODEX_HOME="$T/home" \
  codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini \
  "Reply with exactly: PRECEDENCE_OK" < /dev/null
# -> exit 1; stderr shows auth_mode="ApiKey", auth.recovery_reason="not_chatgpt_auth",
#    "unexpected status 401 Unauthorized: Incorrect API key provided: sk-bogus"
```

--ignore-user-config is narrow: it skips only $CODEX_HOME/config.toml (the help text
says "Do not load $CODEX_HOME/config.toml; auth still uses CODEX_HOME"). A codeword
in $CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md still reaches the model and a $CODEX_HOME/hooks.json
SessionStart hook still fires, with or without the flag. Control run (no flag) and
test run (flag) both show codeword reaching the model and the hook marker written
(hook trust bypassed so the marker is not gated by trust). AGENTS.md and hooks.json
load independently of config.toml.

```
printf 'When asked for the project codeword, answer with exactly: ZEBRAFISH42\n' > "$T/home/AGENTS.md"
# hooks.json SessionStart writes "$T/home/marker.txt"
# control:
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini \
  --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust "What is the project codeword? Answer with one word only." < /dev/null
# -> exit 0; codeword reply = ZEBRAFISH42; marker PRESENT
# test:
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini \
  --ignore-user-config --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust "What is the project codeword? Answer with one word only." < /dev/null
# -> exit 0; codeword reply = ZEBRAFISH42; marker PRESENT (both survive --ignore-user-config)
```

-p <profile> layers $CODEX_HOME/<name>.config.toml on top of the base user config,
but --ignore-user-config suppresses the profile as well. With base config
model_reasoning_effort = "low" and a profile hi.config.toml setting "high": plain run
resolves low, `-p hi` resolves high (profile read), and `-p hi --ignore-user-config`
resolves the built-in default medium (both base config and profile dropped). Read the
resolved effort from stderr (codex.turn.reasoning_effort=...).

```
printf 'model_reasoning_effort = "low"\n'  > "$T/home/config.toml"
printf 'model_reasoning_effort = "high"\n' > "$T/home/hi.config.toml"
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini "Reply with exactly: P_OK" < /dev/null                              # -> reasoning_effort=low
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini -p hi "Reply with exactly: P_OK" < /dev/null                        # -> reasoning_effort=high
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini -p hi --ignore-user-config "Reply with exactly: P_OK" < /dev/null   # -> reasoning_effort=medium (default)
```

Concurrency: 3 codex exec runs launched in parallel against one shared temp
CODEX_HOME all exit 0 and return their distinct outputs; auth.json is not touched.

```
before_m=$(stat -f '%m' "$T/home/auth.json")
for i in 1 2 3; do ( CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" \
  -m gpt-5.4-mini "Reply with exactly: CONC_$i" < /dev/null > "$T/d$i.out" 2>"$T/d$i.err"; echo $? > "$T/d$i.rc" ) & done; wait
cat "$T"/d*.rc            # -> 0 0 0
stat -f '%m' "$T/home/auth.json"   # -> unchanged vs before_m
```

The token in auth.json was not near expiry, so no refresh fired: auth.json mtime and
the last_refresh field are identical before and after. The concurrent-refresh path
was therefore not exercised (a refresh was deliberately not forced, since a refresh
initiated from a temp-home copy of the live token can rotate it server-side). What
concurrency does surface is a benign, non-fatal race on the skills extension: two
runs collide installing the shared system-skills dir, logged as
`ERROR codex_skills_extension::host_service: failed to install system skills: io
error while remove existing system skills dir`. The affected runs still exit 0 with
correct output.

## Project layer trust

A project .codex/config.toml is read only when the project is trusted in the user
config; an untrusted project's config layer is silently skipped. Probe: a project
whose .codex/config.toml sets a bogus model, run once with no [projects] entry and
once with a trust entry. The base user config sets model = "gpt-5.4-mini" as the
fallback so the untrusted arm never calls an unsanctioned model.

```
mkdir -p "$T/proj/.codex"
printf 'model = "bogus-model-xyz"\n' > "$T/proj/.codex/config.toml"
PROJ_REAL=$(cd "$T/proj" && pwd -P)     # canonical path, see note below
```

Untrusted (user config has no [projects] entry): the project config is not read, the
run uses the fallback model gpt-5.4-mini and succeeds.

```
printf 'model = "gpt-5.4-mini"\n' > "$T/home/config.toml"
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" "Reply with exactly: E_OK" < /dev/null
# -> exit 0; stderr and rollout show model=gpt-5.4-mini (project layer ignored)
```

Trusted (user config names the project canonical path): the project config is read
and layered on top, so the bogus model reaches the API and is rejected.

```
{ printf 'model = "gpt-5.4-mini"\n\n'; printf '[projects."%s"]\ntrust_level = "trusted"\n' "$PROJ_REAL"; } > "$T/home/config.toml"
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" "Reply with exactly: E_OK" < /dev/null
# -> exit 1; model=bogus-model-xyz; API 400 invalid_request_error
#    "The 'bogus-model-xyz' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account."
```

Canonical path is mandatory. codex canonicalizes the project cwd before matching the
trust table. On macOS mktemp -d returns /var/folders/... (and /tmp) which are
symlinks into /private/..., so the [projects."..."] key must use the resolved path
(pwd -P). Writing the unresolved path makes the trusted arm behave exactly like the
untrusted arm. Also, in the user config any top-level keys (for example model) must
appear before the first [projects."..."] table, or the key silently joins the table
and parsing fails.

## Quota accounting

Quota and token accounting live in the session rollout, in event_msg records of type
token_count under the temp CODEX_HOME (find "$T/home/sessions" -name '*.jsonl'). A
scrubbed copy of one run is committed at tests/fixtures/codex/rate-limits.json.

```
CODEX_HOME="$T/home" codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check -C "$T/proj" -m gpt-5.4-mini -s read-only \
  "Run these three shell commands one at a time using your shell tool: first 'pwd', then 'date +%Y', then 'echo TOOLCALL_DONE'. After all three, reply with the single word FINISHED." < /dev/null
rf=$(find "$T/home/sessions" -name '*.jsonl' | head -1)
python3 -c "import json;[print(o['payload']['info']['total_token_usage']['total_tokens']) for o in (json.loads(l) for l in open('$rf') if l.strip()) if o.get('payload',{}).get('type')=='token_count']"
```

One token_count record is emitted per model step, not per tool call. A single exec
invocation that makes 3 tool calls produced 4 token_count records: one initial model
step plus one after each tool-call result. Each record carries its own rate_limits
snapshot (limit_id, primary.used_percent, primary.window_minutes, primary.resets_at,
credits, plan_type).

info.total_token_usage.total_tokens accumulates across the whole invocation (the
measured run climbed 11876 -> 23868 -> 35965 -> 48119), while
info.last_token_usage is the per-step usage.

primary.used_percent stayed 0.0 for every record on a 10080-minute window at the
current (very low) utilization. Whether a multi-tool-call turn counts as one
server-side message is therefore NOT resolvable from a used_percent before/after
delta at this utilization; the delta is 0.0 -> 0.0, which is a null result, not a
finding. The observable that is resolvable, and only as a reporting fact about the
records rather than a claim about server-side billing: rate_limits is attached to
every model step (4 snapshots for the 3-tool-call turn), and in the rollout
info.total_token_usage is a running total across the whole invocation while
info.last_token_usage is the per-step usage.
# Runtimes

Facts about how hex agent runtimes behave, captured during the codex parity
spike (Phase 0, 2026-09-07). Each fact carries the exact command that produced
it. Redactions: `<TMP>` for temp paths, `<REDACTED>` / `<ACCOUNT_ID>` for any
account identifier or token.

Environment note (all tasks): the codex 0.153.4 binary is at `~/.local/bin/codex`
(a symlink to `~/.codex/packages/standalone/...`), not `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`
as the spike brief states. Version and ChatGPT login both match the brief.
Command: `codex --version` prints `codex-cli 0.153.4`; `readlink ~/.local/bin/codex`
shows the standalone target.

## goose codex provider

Probed with goose 1.46.0 (`~/.local/bin/goose`, `goose --version` prints `1.46.0`)
driving codex 0.153.4. Every run used an isolated temp `HOME` and a temp
`CODEX_HOME` (with `auth.json` copied in, ChatGPT login) so no real goose or codex
config was touched. `CODEX_COMMAND` pointed at a wrapper that logged codex argv
plus a whitelist of env vars, then exec'd the real codex. Full argv capture is in
`tests/fixtures/codex/goose-codex-argv.txt`.

### Providers available

goose 1.46.0 ships three codex-related providers. The plain `codex` provider (id
`codex`, display "OpenAI Codex CLI") is deprecated in favor of `chatgpt_codex` and
`codex-acp`, and it is the one that shells out to the codex CLI. `chatgpt_codex`
is an OAuth HTTP provider (no subprocess). `codex-acp` uses the
`@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` adapter.
Command: `strings ~/.local/bin/goose | grep -iE 'OpenAI Codex CLI|Deprecated|chatgpt_codex|codex-acp'`
Result: the `codex` entry text reads
`[Deprecated: use chatgpt_codex or codex-acp instead] Execute OpenAI models via Codex CLI tool. Requires codex CLI installed.`
The `codex` provider reads env vars `CODEX_COMMAND`, `CODEX_SKIP_GIT_CHECK`, and
`CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT`. Source files seen in the binary:
`crates/goose/src/providers/codex.rs`, `chatgpt_codex.rs`, `codex_acp.rs`.

### How provider and model are chosen

Command: `goose run --help`
Result: `--provider <P>` overrides the `GOOSE_PROVIDER` env var, `--model <M>`
overrides `GOOSE_MODEL`; both otherwise come from `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`.
A recipe can set them via `settings.goose_provider` and `settings.goose_model`.
Non-interactive execution is `goose run --no-session -q` (there is no `--yolo`
flag on goose itself; approval behavior is set by `GOOSE_MODE`, one of `auto`,
`approve`, `smart_approve`, `chat`).

Confirmed with a recipe (offline, no model call):
Command: `goose run --recipe <TMP>/recipe.yaml --render-recipe`
Recipe settings used:
```
settings:
  goose_provider: codex
  goose_model: gpt-5.4-mini
```
Result: the render echoed the recipe back, which only confirms it parses. That
the recipe actually drives the run is shown by the live auto run below: it set no
`--provider`/`--model` on the CLI, the captured env had `GOOSE_PROVIDER` and
`GOOSE_MODEL` both `<unset>`, and HOME was isolated (no config.yaml), yet the run
reached provider `codex` with model `gpt-5.4-mini`. goose's own request log
`<TMP>/home/.local/state/goose/logs/llm_request.0.jsonl` recorded
`"model_name":"gpt-5.4-mini"` with `"command":"<TMP>/bin/codex-wrap.sh"`, and the
cli log recorded `"gen_ai.provider.name":"codex"`.

### Codex invocation and argv

goose spawns the codex CLI (through `CODEX_COMMAND`) as:
```
<CODEX_COMMAND> exec -c model_reasoning_effort="<effort>" --json [--yolo] -
```
The prompt is piped to codex on stdin (the positional `-`). goose forwards no
model to codex: the argv has no `-m`, `--model`, or `-c model=` token in any of
the three captured runs (see the fixture), and goose does not write codex config.
codex therefore takes its model from the temp CODEX_HOME `config.toml`, which this
probe pinned to `model = "gpt-5.4-mini"` (confirmed by `turn_context.model =
"gpt-5.4-mini"` in the rollout below).
`CODEX_SKIP_GIT_CHECK=true` was set on every run but never appeared in the argv,
so goose does not translate it into codex `--skip-git-repo-check`.
Command that produced the argv (full capture in the fixture):
```
env HOME=<TMP>/home CODEX_HOME=<TMP>/codexhome \
    CODEX_COMMAND=<TMP>/bin/codex-wrap.sh CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT=high \
    CODEX_SKIP_GIT_CHECK=true GOOSE_MODE=auto GOOSE_DISABLE_KEYRING=true \
    GOOSE_DISABLE_SESSION_NAMING=true \
    goose run --no-session -q --recipe <TMP>/recipe.yaml < /dev/null
```
Captured argv: `exec -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --json --yolo -`.
The run exited 0 and the model replied `READY`.

### Approval and sandbox mapping (the rollout)

`GOOSE_MODE=auto` makes goose pass `--yolo` to `codex exec`. The resulting codex
rollout `turn_context` records `approval_policy = "never"` and
`sandbox_policy = {"type": "danger-full-access"}`.
Command (after the auto run above, read the newest rollout):
```
python3 -c 'import json,glob;
p=sorted(glob.glob("<TMP>/codexhome/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl",recursive=True))[-1];
[print(json.dumps(json.loads(l)["payload"])) for l in open(p)
 if l.strip() and json.loads(l).get("type")=="turn_context"]'
```
Result (cwd and ids redacted):
```
approval_policy: "never"
approvals_reviewer: "user"
sandbox_policy: {"type": "danger-full-access"}
permission_profile: {"type": "disabled"}
model: "gpt-5.4-mini"
reasoning_effort: "high"
```
So yes: auto mode (codex `--yolo`) maps to `danger-full-access` plus `never`
approval.

`GOOSE_MODE=approve` drops `--yolo` from the argv (observed in the fixture).
Command: `env ... GOOSE_MODE=approve ... goose run --no-session -q --recipe <TMP>/recipe.yaml < /dev/null`
Captured argv: `exec -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --json -` (no `--yolo`).
A turn_context was not read for the approve run, so the resulting codex policy
(codex defaults: on-request approval, workspace-write sandbox) is inferred, not
observed. The probe prompt used no tools, so approve-mode tool gating in
non-interactive goose is untested here.

### CODEX_COMMAND is honored

The wrapper set as `CODEX_COMMAND` was invoked on every run (it wrote its argv
log), and `GOOSE_CODEX_DEBUG=1` printed the constructed command.
Command: `env ... GOOSE_CODEX_DEBUG=1 ... goose run --no-session -q --recipe <TMP>/recipe.yaml < /dev/null`
Result: goose stdout contained `=== CODEX PROVIDER DEBUG ===` and
`Command: "<TMP>/bin/codex-wrap.sh"`, matching the wrapper path in the fixture.

### CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT is honored

goose translates `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` into codex `-c model_reasoning_effort="<value>"`.
When unset, the effort defaults to `high`.
Command (fresh HOME to rule out persisted state):
```
env HOME=<TMP>/home2 CODEX_HOME=<TMP>/codexhome \
    CODEX_COMMAND=<TMP>/bin/codex-wrap.sh CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT=low \
    CODEX_SKIP_GIT_CHECK=true GOOSE_MODE=auto GOOSE_DISABLE_KEYRING=true \
    goose run --no-session -q --recipe <TMP>/recipe.yaml < /dev/null
```
Captured argv: `exec -c model_reasoning_effort="low" --json --yolo -`. With the
env var unset the argv showed `model_reasoning_effort="high"`, so `low` proves
the override is honored.
Command (distinguish the two providers' env var names):
`strings ~/.local/bin/goose | grep -oE '(CHATGPT_)?CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT' | sort -u`
Result: both `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` (the `codex` CLI provider) and
`CHATGPT_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` (the `chatgpt_codex` OAuth provider) are present.
